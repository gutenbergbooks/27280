                      Honourable RICHARD _Lord_ ROBERTS

                                HONOVRABLE SIR,

  Although it bee true (which a       |
  worthy Diuine[a] obserueth) that    | [Note a: M^r. _Bolter_ Disc. of
  formall Hypocrites are heartned and | true Happinesse, p. 61.]
  hardned in their lewd courses &     |
  false conceits of happinesse, when  |
  they heare more infamous Sinners    |
  than themselues, gloriously and     |
  flatteringly commended at their     |
  Deaths; yet we need not feare any   |
  such bad effect by the              |
  Funerall-commendation of Gods true  |
  Saints; because the publike         |
  Testimonie of their iust Praises    |
  doth not onely make the wicked more |
  inexcusable, and the Glory of Gods  |
  Graces shine farre brighter to      |
  Posteritie; but also enkindleth in  |
  the hearts of the godly a greater   |
  fire of Zeale for imitation. These  | [Note b: _Psalm. 37. 37. Deut.

  whereof the _Feare of the Lord is   | [Note h: _Prou. 9. 10._]

  themselues: I dare say with Saint   | [Note i: _Epist. 125._ where S.

  able to encline and enlarge them    |
  to the pursuit and practise of so   |
  excellent and Glorious a Grace as   |
  the _Feare of the Lord_; because    |
  this godly Feare and the impenitent |
  Allowance of any lust, is as        |
  incompatible as Heauen and Hell: so |
  that if you should hate to be       |
  diuorced from your Bosome-sin       |
  whatsoeuer it be (which God forbid) |
  you could haue no true right and    |
  interest to the precious promises   |
  of this and of that other life[n].  | [Note n: _1 Tim. 4. 8._]
  Thinke on this continually, and     |
  hold it your greatest Honour, the   |
  Noblest imployment of your Soule,   |
  as it is indeed, to keep your selfe |
  (as a King[o] did before you.) from | [Note o: _Psal. 18. 23._]
  your iniquitie. _Quod si tu (quod   |

                                THE PRAISE OF A
                                  Godly Woman.

                  _--But a woman that feareth the Lord, shee
                                shall be praised._

  Praise is a Debt (saith _Gregory    |
  Nazianzen_[a]) and it must be paid, | [Note a: _Orat. 25. fol. 439. Rom.
  not to men alone, but to women      | 13. 7, 8._]
  also; yet not to euery woman, be    |
  shee neuer so noble, wittie,        | [Note: The Diuision.]
  wealthy or faire[b], vnlesse she be |
  godly withall: For _fauour is       | [Note b: _Non possumus reprehendere
  deceitfull, and beautie is vaine;   | diuini artificis opus; sed quem
  but a woman that feareth the Lord,  | delectat corporis pulchritudo,
  shee shall be praised_.             | multo magis illa delectet venustas,
                                      | quæ ad imaginem, Dei est intus, non
  A promise this is and affirmatiue,  | foris comptior. S. Ambr. Instit.
  and an affirmatiue promise hath two | Virg. c. 4. Prou. 11. 22. Eccle.
  parts in it. The first is the       | 11. 2. ... Homo igitur mihi non tam
  Partie to whom it is made, and shee | vultu quam affectu admirand^s
  is _Muliertimens Dominum_. _A woman | emineat atque excellat: vt in his
  that feareth the Lord_, which is    | laudatur, in quibus etiam Deus
  also the reason why she shall be    | prophetico iudicio laudatur de quo
  praised: euen because she is _a     | scriptum est Psal. 66. 5.
  woman fearing the Lord_. The second | Terribilis in consiliis super
  is the thing promised, and that is  | filios hominum; cuius opera coram
  _Laudabitur, she shall be praised_. | Deo luceant, qui bona iugibus
                                      | operibus facta contexat. Id. ib.
                                      | cap. 3._]
  In the former, it is not enough     |
  that she is a woman, because        | [Note I.]
  euery woman is not _Timens_, one    |
  that _Feareth_, nor sufficient that | [Note c: _Naturale vocabul[=u] est
  she _Feareth_; because euery woman  | Foemina. naturalis vocabuli
  that feareth is not _Timens         | generale, Mulier.--Tert. de Virg.
  Dominum_, one _that feareth the     | Veland. cap 4._]
  Lord_; but _she_ that _shall be     |
  praised_, is all three. 1. A woman  | [Note d: _Aliud est Timere
  by nature[c], where the weaker her  | simpliciter, aliud Timere
  sex is, the more shee shall be      | Deum----quippe timere & amare
  commended. 2. By Grace[d], _a woman | simpliciter prolata, affectione:
  that feareth_, where the continuall | cu^m additamento aute virtutes
  act of this Fearing is required. 3. | signific[=a]t. Simplices nempe
  _That feareth the Lord_, where the  | affectiones insunt naturaliter

                                      | Arb._]
  And in the latter we are to         |
  consider; First, to what matters,   | [Note II.]
  _Laudabitur_, her praise will       |
  reach, and in what respect to       |
  _Ipsa_ Her person. Then secondly,   |
  When _she shall be praised_; not    |
  for the present, perhaps, no more   |
  than she hath beene heretofore; yet |
  _Laudabitur_, the time will come    |
  when _she shall be praised_, and    |
  then too her praise shall so be,    |
  that it shall be still. Thirdly, of |
  whom shee shall haue praise, for    |
  _Laudabitur_ is an action, and must |
  bee done of some agent, therefore   |
  we must finde who shal praise her,  |
  and they will fall out to be her    |
  Husband and her Children (if she    |
  haue them[e]) and if they faile in  | [Note e: _Mulier enim no naturâ
  this dutie, then the godly shall    | nomen est vxoris, sed vxor
  praise her; and if they cease to    | coditione nomen est mulieris. Tert.
  doe it, then her own workes shall   | ib. c. 5. Gen. 2. 23. Hæc vocabitur
  praise her, yea rather than faile,  | mulier, quoniam de viro suo sumpta
  God himselfe shall praise her,      | est: Quia sumpta est (inquit) de
  which is best of all. So sure she   | viro suo, non quia virum experta
  is to be praised, not for the       | ... Non enim corruptelæ, sed sexus
  present onely, but for euer. And so | vocabulum est. Gal. 4. 4. Luke 1.
  this Text besides that it is a      | 28. S. Ambr. ibid. c. 5._]
  _Promise_, it is also a _Motiue_ to |
  stirre vs vp to feare God, that so  | [Note: A Promise, and Motiue.]
  we also may haue true and eternall  |
  praise of God. It is both, and      | [Note: _I. The partie that shall be
  both waies wee to haue vse of it,   | praised._]
  as of a _Promise_, and as of a      |
  _Motiue_: both these waies at once; |
  _A woman that feareth the Lord she  |
  shall be praised._                  |
                                      |
  A weake sex[f] to beginne with, and | [Note f: _1 Pet. 3. 7. Ier. 50.
  yet being strengthned by Grace[g],  | 37. Nah. 3. 13. Gal. 3. 27, 28._]
  no impediment; but that a woman as  |
  wel as a man may feare the Lord,    | [Note g: _--Ex parte natura (nisi
  and haue praise of him, and so      | sit fortitude maioris gratiæ)
  become the partie who shall, and    | faciliùs incarnatur ad malum sexus
  one Reason too, why _shee shall be  | formineus. Bonau. L. 2. d. 21. q.
  praised_.                           | 3. p. 18._]
                                      |
  For a woman must be more good than  |
  nature, art, policie, preferment    |
  can make her, else shee is not good |
  enough for Gods Spirit to praise    |
  her. He commends neither men nor    |
  women considered in their pure      |
  Naturalls only, in that estate of   |
  corruption, they all heare alike to | [Note h: _Rom. 3. 9._]
  their disgrace, that they are _All  |
  vnder sinne[h]_, _All come[i] short | [Note i: _Rom. 3. 23._]
  of the glory of God_, and are _All  |
  the children of[k] wrath_, because  | [Note k: _Ephes. 2. 3._]
  they _Are without all feare of      |
  God_[l]                             | [Note l: _Rom. 3. 18._]
                                      |
  By nature then both sexes are alike |
  faultie, alike disc[=o]mendable in  |
  Gods sight, and so they should be   |
  in ours. We should not dispraise    |
  women more than men, for the sex    |
  sake only (as some doe[m]) because  | [Note m: _Eurip. Plutarc. de
  they haue as noble soules as men,   | Tranquilit Mulier quantibuis proba,
  for[n] soules haue no sexes, (as    | Mulier tamen est._]
  Saint _Ambrose_ saith) nor praise   |
  women for the endowments of the     | [Note n: _Anima enim sexum non
  flesh onely (as othersome doe[o])   | habet.--De Virg. som. 1. lib: 3.
  vnlesse they be adorned also with   | fol. 99._]
  the sauing Graces of the Spirit,    |
  whereof a chiefe one is not noble   | [Note o: _Cornel. Agrip. de
  birth, great wealth, excellent wit, | Nobilit. foeminei sexus. Bocacius
  or rare beautie: but _the feare of  | de claris mulieribus._]
  the Lord_, his treasure.[A] This    |
  godly feare is that, that makes a   | [Note A: _Es. 33. 6._]
  Woman in relation[p] to God,        |
  praise-worthy. And good reason it   | [Note p: _Caiet. in. loc._]
  should do so, if we regard the      |
  weaknesse of a woman, in whom so    |
  excellent a Grace as _the feare of  |
  the Lord_, is found, and the        |
  Noblenesse of fearing the Lord,     |
  being so found.                     |
                                      |
  First, a womans weaknesse is        |
  naturally[q] greater than the mans, | [Note q: _Naturaliter etiam maior
  and therefore by how much her flesh | lucti est inter carnem et
  is weaker, and her spirit lesse     | spirit[=u] mulieris quam viri:

  hath, is more difficult, and the    | spiritus minus promptus, tãtò pugna

  nor of Euery one[l], for Praise is  |
  not comely in the mouth of euery    | [Note l: _Luk. 6. 26. Eccles. 15.
  one, of euery scoffing _Ishmael_.   | 9._]
                                      |
  But first of the Time.              | [Note m: _Esay 28. 16. 30. 18. 40.
                                      | 31. 64. 4. Heb. 10. 36, 37, 38.
  Many when they heare a Promise (and | Hab. 2. 3, 4._]
  a Promise I told you at first, this |
  is) thinke to haue it by and by;    | [Note n: _1 Cor. 4. 5._]
  but they marke not, that a Promise  |
  and the Fruition of it is not all   | [Note o: _1 Pet. 1. 7. Et nos
  at once. It must be waited for[m],  | ergò n[=o] a nobis laudem exigamus,
  especially this Promise of Praise:  | nec præripiamus iudicium Dei &
  _Vntill the Lord come_ (as the      | præueniamus sententiam iudicis, sed
  Apostles limit the Time) _and       | suo Tempori, suo Iudici

  his Appearing_[o], _Her Faith shall | Eccles. 11. 27.28._]

  and Glory_. Therefore in the mean   | [Note p: _Nam si laudari antè
  while, best for her to _Feare the   | Gubernator non potest quam in

  1. Not only because it is safest    | Ambr. de Bono Mort. c. 8. tom. 4.
  praising Her as a Master of a ship  | Meritò ergò differtur, vt sequatur

  that (as _Arrianus_ reports) it     | Virg. c. 3. tom. 1._]
  grew greater than two Cubits[r].    |
                                      | [Note q: _Act. 12. 21._]
  2. Nor only because actuall praise  |
  is in the lips of the praiser, and  | [Note r: _Arrian. Epict. l. 3. c.
  so a wicked woman may be praised,   | 2._]
  and yet not be worthy of it, and a  |
  godly woman may be praise-worthy,   |
  and yet not haue it, whereas        |
  praise-worthinesse is euer in the   |
  partie to be praised, and fewest    |
  (you know) haue this worth; but     |
  many haue praise without it,        |
  therefore praise-worthinesse is the |
  Nobler Grace of the two, and        |
  consequently best for a Woman to be |
  worthy of praise, though she be not |
  praised for the present.            |
                                      |
  3. But one of the chiefest Reasons  |
  is this; because indeed all our     |
  earthly praise is _Laudatur_, that  |
  is, for the present; but continueth |
  not. Is, but shall not be.          |
  Sometimes a godly woman is          |
  commended, and sometimes she is     |
  not. As S. _Paul_ praised the       |
  _Corinthians_[s], _Now I praise you | [Note s: _1 Cor. 11. 1, 22_]
  Brethren_, and by and by he saith:  |
  _Shall I praise you in this? I      |
  praise you not_: whereas This       |
  praise here promised so Is, that it |
  _shall be_ still, and that cannot   |
  be in this Transitory world; but in |
  Heauen, where Her praise that       |
  feareth the Lord for euer, endureth |
  for euer: _Laudabitur, She shall be |
  praised_.                           |
                                      |
  The best Time then for commending   | [Note: III.
  Her is yet to come, and that from   | _Of whom shee shal be praised._]
  Him who can best doe it; But I must |
  tell you first, this Time should    | [Note t: _2 Kings 9. 11. Act. 24.
  neuer come, could the scoffing      | 5. & 26. 24. Neh. 6. 13._]
  _Ishmaels_ of our daies be heard    |
  railing vpon, iesting at, belying   | [Note u: _Tert. Apolog. c. 7. &c.

  many disgracefull censures to dimme | [Note x: _Gratias ago Deo meo, quod
  the glory of the children of Light, | dignus sum, quem mundus oderit._
  spitefully to aggrauate their       | _S. Ierom. Asellæ._]
  tender frailties, rather than to    |
  commend their vnreproueable Graces. | [Note y: _Ephes. 5. 15. Phil. 4.

  praise, when all is done[a], 2 Cor. | [Note a: _2 Cor. 10. 18. Iob. 12.

  euerlasting Praise; so that should  |
  her Husband and Children faile to   |
  praise Her, which yet they do not,  |
  for they commend Her in the 29.     |
  verse of this Chapter, saying:      |
  _Many daughters haue done           |
  vertuously; but thou excellest them |
  all_[f]: or should the Godly cease  | [Note f: _Prou. 31. 28, 29._]

  But though we haue brought a Godly  |
  Woman where she would be, to        |
  Heauenly Praise, and Honour, and    |
  Glory, and found them by Gods free  |
  fauour in Christ giuen vnto Her;    |
  yet who is such a Woman? We haue    |
  not found Her yet; and why not yet? |
  Because among other reasons, as     |
  Saint _Ierom_ was afraid to entreat |
  of the Death of that Venerable      |
  Matron _Paula_[r]; so am I to       | [Note r: _Quid agimus anima? cur ad

  neuerthelesse Honour to be giuen    |
  Her in that respect; but rather the |
  more (as Saint _Peters_ inference   |

  chiefly by reason of that spiritual |
  Helpe and refreshment, which they   |
  might get by conuersing with Her in |
  the choicest passages of            |
  Sanctification. For shee had the    |
  Art to vphold holy conferences      |
  about perplexities of conscience,   |
  Relapses into sin, and Remedies     |
  against the same: Shee had the      |

  the Death of any of Gods zealous    | [Note e: _Paulin. in Vitâ D.

  would speake aloud of her constant  |
  reading, hearing, meditating on the |

  solitary conferences with her God,  |
  feruent prayers and eiaculations,   |
  which (as the sweetest incense)     |
  shee euer and anon sent vp to the   |
  Throne of Grace for the pardon of   |
  her sinnes, the fauour of God, the  |
  spirituall Good of her Dearest      |
  Husband, Children, and Gods Church. |

  home, being summoned by Sicknesse,  |
  by and by she set her _House in     |
  order_, like _Hezekiah_; She spake  |
  to the Hearts of Her Children,      |
  Friends, and Seruants, that were    |
  then about Her (like _Iacob_) by    |
  putting them in remembrance of Her  |
  Departure and their Duties: She     |
  hungered and thirsted after the     |
  Body and Bloud of Her Dearest       | [Note: _Worthy receiving the
  Sauiour, which shee receiued with   | Sacrament._]
  Due Examination[p] of Her           |

                                      |
  And now (Beloued) that she lieth on |
  the bed of Languishing, we must not |
  be austere in reprehending euery    |
  Infirmity; but Pitifull in          |
  considering the tender frailtie of  |
  it.                                 |
                                      |

  short moment and violent passions   |
  of Her Death; but according to the  |
  holy Actions of Her Health, the     |
  former Affections of Her Heart, and |
  the Generall Course of Her Life[q]; | [Note q: M^r. _Greenham_. 1. Treat.

  by reason of the parching Feauer of |
  the Spirit, as well as of the Body, |

  (as the Physitian of the body could |
  discerne) though not in her Memory. |
  Consider therefore O Man (as that   |
  excellent Physitian of the Soule    |
  aduiseth thee[r]) if thou canst     | [Note r: _Id. Of Death, fol. 9.

  must much more beare with a fraile  |
  Minde and Body too. Consider also O |
  Man, that this her Pettishnesse did |
  more wound her to the heart, than   |
  any iniury thou couldst presse her  |
  with. Neither doe I speake this to  |
  nourish passion in any, or to proue |
  her Anger to be Sinlesse[s]; but to | [Note s: _Vitemus ergò aut

  Faith quenched the flame of this    |
  fiery passion in Christs Bloud,     |
  resolued and melted her heart into  |
  many penitent Teares afterwards.    | [Note: _Repentance for the same._]
  Oh, said she to me, (pressing her   |
  with _Dauids_ example, _Psal.       |
  131._) In my Health I could digest  |
  any iniury, and deemed it base and  |
  vngodly, not to be able to doe so;  |
  but now (I know not how) me thinkes |
  I am ouer-tender in bearing them. I |
  am impatient indeed, and then I     |
  weepe for my impatiencie. For I     |
  know (as she her selfe vrged) _The  |
  wrath of Man doth not accomplish    | [Note t: _Iam. 1. 20. Psalm. 4.
  the Righteousnesse of God_[t].      | 4._]
                                      |
  Thus shee was Angrie with her selfe | [Note u: _Ephes. 4. 26. Vel certè

  her groaning vunder the dolefull    |
  pangs of Death, vnder those pangs   |
  of which shee had foretold saying:  |
  I shall suffer much more ere I goe  |
  hence. And can any haue the heart   |
  to heare her groaning pangs,        |
  without renting his owne heart from |
  his darling pleasure? without       |
  lamenting his owne sinnes, which    |
  vnlesse he forsake betimes, will    |
  bring him to euerlasting            | [Note x: _Ezek. 18. 13, 30._]

  compassionate euery weake one, to   | [Note y: _--Si quem viderimus

  of this her Agonie, after shee had  |
  layen groaning many houres without  |
  any articulate or distinct speech,  |
  yet vpon triall made of Her sense   |
  and memory by demanding of Her,     |
  whether she would haue prayers made |
  for Her, she answered plainly: With |
  all my heart, pray, pray. And then  |
  as _Gregory Nazianzen_[a] reports   | [Note a: _Orat. 28. de Funere
  of his Father, that though He was   | Patris. Tom. 2._]
  daily, yea hourely, in great paine  |
  before his Death, yet He was euer   |
  still and quiet from paine, onely   |
  while Diuine Seruice was saying; so |
  this Deuout Lady forgetting (as it  |
  were) Her former Groanings, did     |
  listen attentiuely to the prayers   |
  that were made for Her, without     |
  fetching so much as one sob during  |
  that time. And afterwards           |
  rehearsing distinctly part of the   |
  Lords Prayer, you might heare Her,  |
  when S. _Stephens_ Vision and last  |

  very often these last words of Her  |

  Thus on a sudden I haue told you    | [Note A: _Reuel. 14. 13._]
  how she _Dyed in the Lord_[A], and  |
  is _with Christ_[B].                | [Note B _Phil. 1. 23._]
                                      |
  And though we saw her afterwards    |
  mouing her lips; but heard not her  |
  Voice, no more than they that were  |
  at Saint _Ambroses_ Death did heare | [Note d: _Paulin. in D. Ambros
  his Voice; but only saw his lips    | Vita._]
  moue[d]; yet we must not thinke     |
  _The Spirit of strength_[e], of     | [Note e: _Esai. 11. 2._]
  _Prayer_ and _Grace_[f], is then    |
  onely strong, when we heare a Dying | [Note f: _Zach. 12. 10._]
  Saint pray, because Christs Spirit  |
  cries in Gods Children, _Abba,      |
  Father_[g], with Vnutterable        | [Note g: _Gal. 4. 6._]
  Groanings[h] which we cannot heare, |
  and therefore I doubt not, but this | [Note h: _Rom. 8. 26._]
  Elect Lady cried loudest in Gods    |
  eares, when we heard not her words; |
  and why may we not thinke now, our  |
  sinnes hindered vs from hearing     |
  them? I am sure, heretofore she     |
  hath spoken againe and againe many  |
  Heart-piercing speeches to deterre  |
  from Sinne, and to allure to        |
  Holinesse of Life. If she be not    |
  hearkened to now, henceforth wee    |
  shall heare Her speake no more. _I  |
  charge you therefore before God and |
  the Lord Iesus Christ, and the      |
  Elect Angells_:[A] you (I say) I    | [Note A: _1 Tim. 5. 21._]
  charge whomsoeuer shee hath iustly  |
  reproued for any Sin, that you      |
  forsake those Sins; and whomsoeuer  |
  she hath zealously exhorted to holy |
  Duties, that you performe those     |
  holy Duties, for henceforth you     |
  shall heare Her speake no more.     |
                                      |
  But why should I detaine thee       | [Note: _Conclusion. Sed quid ego te
  (Honourable Lady) any longer? Or    | morer Frater? quid expectem? vt
